This folder contains csv simulation outputs generated using the MGDrivE framework in R. Outputs are organised by gene drive system and simulation type.

Subdirectories:

- bisex_runs/
    ↳ realistic_bisex_runs/      : Outputs incorporating ecological realism (e.g. overlapping generations, larval carryover)
    ↳ actual_bisex_runs/         : Outputs based on mathematically idealised assumptions (discrete generations, no larval population)
    ↳ dataframe/                 : Contains aggregated or summarised output tables (e.g. combined time series) for downstream analysis and figure generation.

- two_loci/
    ↳ realistic_two_loci/      : Realistic simulations of the two-locus (split-drive) MEREA system
    ↳ actual_two_loci/         : Idealised simulations of the two-locus system
    ↳ dataframe/               : Dataframe of two locus system

Note:
The distinction between `actual_run` and `realistic_run` follows the modelling framework described in the report: 'actual' refers to idealised, deterministic models without ecological complexity; 'realistic' includes features like persistent larval populations and temporal release schedules.
